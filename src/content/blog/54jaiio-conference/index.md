## üìÑ Presenting My Article 

On August 4th, 2025, I had the honor of **presenting my article** at the **[54th JAIIO (Argentine Conference on Informatics and Operations Research)](https://54jaiio.sadio.org.ar/)**, within the **ASSE (Argentine Symposium on Software Engineering)**.  

The event was held at the **[Pabell√≥n Cero + Infinito](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FyJ6i9yjnTR6QaKq9)** of the Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences at the University of Buenos Aires ‚Äî a modern space that perfectly matched the spirit of innovation and collaboration.

My article is distilled from my [thesis work](/blog/academia). Condensing ideas into a concise conference paper was challenging, but also rewarding.  

Presenting it at ASSE was a milestone for me: it allowed me to share my findings with the software engineering community.

The audience posed thoughtful questions, ranging from practical implementation concerns to potential new directions.

## üåç A Space for Growth  
Since 1961, JAIIO‚Äîorganized by the **[Argentine Society of Informatics (SADIO)](https://sadio.org.ar/)**‚Äîhas been a landmark event for the computing community in Argentina. Being part of this conference reaffirmed the importance of **sharing knowledge through publication and dialogue**. It‚Äôs not only about presenting results but also about building bridges with others who are working on related challenges.
